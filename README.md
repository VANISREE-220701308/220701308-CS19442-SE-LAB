**📌 Project Overview**

1.The Student Grade Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate the management of academic records in educational institutions. This system enables teachers, administrators, and students to interact with student grade data in a secure, scalable, and efficient manner.

2.It resolves the challenges of traditional manual record-keeping systems by providing real-time access, minimizing human errors, and supporting timely decision-making in the education process.


**🎯 Core Features**

✅ User Authentication
Secure login for different user roles—teachers, administrators, and students.

✅ Mark Entry
Teachers can enter, update, and manage marks for various subjects and assessments.

✅ Grade Calculation
The system automatically calculates grades based on predefined grading rules.

✅ Report Generation
Generate performance reports by student, subject, or class for academic review.

✅ 24/7 Accessibility
Access grade records from any internet-enabled device—anytime, anywhere.

✅ Data Security
Implements strong authentication and encryption to protect sensitive student data.


**🧠 Problem Statement**

1Traditional methods of student mark management are:


Issue	Description:

⏳ Time-Consuming	Manual data entry and processing are inefficient.

❌ Prone to Errors	Susceptible to mistakes in calculation and data handling.

🔄 Difficult to Manage	Lacks proper data tracking and scalability.

📉 Reduced Productivity	Repetitive administrative tasks reduce staff efficiency.

🕒 Delayed Results	No real-time performance insights or fast reporting.

   This project addresses the above concerns by automating the end-to-end grade management workflow.
   

**🚧 Project Constraints**

T1.echnology Dependency  : System downtime can disrupt operations.

2.Parental Involvement   : Limited tools for parents to track student progress.

3.Data Security Risks      : Sensitive student data requires robust protection.

4.Scalability              : Performance may degrade with increasing users if not optimized.

5.Maintenance & Support    : Ongoing updates and support are necessary for system reliability.


**🛠️ Functional Modules**

1.Module	Functionality

2.Login System	Role-based access for teachers, admins, and students

3.Mark Management	Input, edit, and view marks per subject AND
Grade Computation	Auto-calculation of grades from raw marks

4.Reporting Dashboard	Student-wise or subject-wise analytics

5.Admin Controls	Class creation, user assignment, system monitoring

**🧪 Sample User Flow**

Teacher Login → Select Class → Enter Marks → Save Grades → View Report
Admin Login → Create Class → Assign Teachers → Monitor Reports
Student Login → View Grade Reports
